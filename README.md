# Another Chess Project
The goal of this project is to train an AI using a camera to determine the position of a chessboard. With this function comes many different applications such as AI, connectivity with Lichess, move suggestions, etc.

## Key Functionality
The enclosed program will keep track of the board. The current state of the board as viewed by the AI will be displayed on the board. As a move is made, the screen will indicate the legality of the move. Different gamemodes can be selected via a UI.

## Planned Features
